This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS).


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://gingerlox.github.io/fem-blog-card-challenge/](https://gingerlox.github.io/fem-blog-card-challenge/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was mostly simple, however resizing the font based on screen size without media queries and vertically aliigning the profile image as a ::before took a while to figure out. Linked some resources below detailing what helped me with this.

### Continued development

Plan to keep doing challenges and projects like this to further improve my CSS layout skills.

### Useful resources
